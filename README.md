# Calculator
I have watched a video made by Harris bhaiya (Code With Harry) and I have added a few functionalities of my own as percentage(%) and factorial(!) and I have mimicked the iOS style of UI for the UI of my calculator app. I have learnt loads about DOM Manipulation and got a hands-on approach to Javascript.
